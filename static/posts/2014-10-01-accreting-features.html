        <h3>Features that applications end up needing</h3>
        <p>
          Software applications that are more than a toy tend to accrete various features. Over the years I've noticed a few common features that are present in many applications and it might be worth taking a note of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Audit trail</li>
            <li>Workflow</li>
            <li>Event triggering</li>
            <li>Versioning</li>
            <li>Content searching</li>
            <li>Undo actions</li>
            <li>Error reporting</li>
            <li>Self-monitoring</li>
            <li>Performance analysis</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you've ever had to add any of these features without much warning you'll know it can be quite painful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good thing about this list is that a lot of them are related. Versioning and Undo, for example, could be coded as inverse operations.
